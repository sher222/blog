I"7<p>Hi, my name is Sheryl Hsu. I’m a high school junior from San Jose, California who’s interested in the intersection of social entrepreneurship and computer science.</p>

<hr />

<p>I am quite active within my school community. I’m honored to be the CEO of my school’s <a href="http://warriortides.github.io">MATE ROV team</a>. I’m also fortunate to be involved in the ISS program, where I have the chance to design and build an experiment that is then sent to the International Space Station. I’m also the engineering lead for my school’s Rainforest xPrize team, which is working on developing robots to analyze biodiversity in rainforests as part of the Rainforest xPrize competition. I am also the founder and president of my school’s Competitive Programming Club as well as an officer in other clubs such as Girls Who Code, Math Club, USAPhO, and 3D Design.</p>

<p>Outside of school, I am a USACO gold participant and AIME qualifier. My business concept, Supply Drop, was also a top 20 winner worldwide in the 2019 Diamond Challenge. I currently serve as a member on the Diamond Challenge Student Advisory Board. In my free time, I love working on side projects with 3D printing or arduino/rpi. I previously worked on a project titled Vaccinations For All, which was an autonomous vaccination system designed to increase the accessibility of vaccinations and reduce the spread of blood-borne diseases. Vaccinations for All received an Honorable Mention in the 2020 Silicon Valley Synopsys Science Fair. I also play jazz trombone and previously studied piano.</p>

<p>I’ve also had the privilege of attending multiple events and camps. I am a SUMaC(Stanford University Mathematics Camp) 2020 alumni. I was also a 2020 NASA SEES(STEM Enhancement in Earth Space Science) intern. I’ve also attended many events such as various hackathons, summits, festivals, and tournaments.</p>
