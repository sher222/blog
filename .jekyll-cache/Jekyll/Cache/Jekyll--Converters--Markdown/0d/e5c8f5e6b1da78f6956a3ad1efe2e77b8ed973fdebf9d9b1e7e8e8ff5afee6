<p>I’m going to be showing you how to install opencv2 on a raspberry pi running Raspbian Buster Lite. I know a lot of tutorials exist for this already but many are outdated and are also not for Raspbian Lite, which doesn’t have a GUI. I’ve tested this on the 3B+ and 4 with both the normal and contrib versions of cv2.</p>

<p>I’m going to assume that you already have Raspbian Lite setup on your pi.</p>

<p>Being by installing pip3</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo apt-get install python-pip3</code></p>

<p>Now, we’re going to install <a href="https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python-headless/">open cv2</a>. We’re going to install the headless version since Raspian Lite doesn’t have a GUI.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pip3 install opencv-contrib-python-headless</code></p>

<p>If you don’t need the extra packages that come with contrib simply install <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">opencv-python-headless</code> instead.</p>

<p>Note that all the opencv packages use the same namespace, so if you installed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">opencv-python</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">opencv-contrib-python</code> previously uninstall them.</p>

<p>If this comand seems to hang on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Running setup.py bdist_wheel for numpy</code>, don’t worry about it…it just takes a while.</p>

<p>Now we get to have fun installing the rest of the dependencies.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev libharfbuzz-dev liblapack-dev libatlas-base-dev libwebp-dev 	libtiff-dev libjasper-dev libilmbase23 openexr 	libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev 	libgtk-3-dev
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If this fails try running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo apt-get update</code> and then trying again.</p>

<p>This completes the installation. If you can sucessfully import opencv2, great!</p>

<p>However, if you get an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">undefined symbol: __atomic_fetch_add_8</code> error, you will need to run your script using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libatomic.so.1 python3 scriptName.py</code>. This is a known <a href="https://github.com/piwheels/packages/issues/59">issue</a> and there doesn’t really seem to be a better solution. I’ll continue to update this and this problem will hopefully be fixed in future releases.</p>
