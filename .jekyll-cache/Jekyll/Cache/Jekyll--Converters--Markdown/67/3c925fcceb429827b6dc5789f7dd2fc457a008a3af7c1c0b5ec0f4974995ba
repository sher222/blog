I"¸	<p>On October 10-11, 2020, I attended <a href="https://mathprize.atfoundation.org">Math Prize for Girls</a>. MathPrize for Girls is typically an event held yearly at MIT in Boston, Massachusetts, but like so many other things in 2020, it was held over zoom instead. Girls are chosen to participate based on their AMC scores, with the cutoff for Math Prize usually a bit below the AIME cutoff.</p>

<p>Normally, a contest is held during MathPrize with cash prizes worth thousands of dollars, but this year they decided to not have a contest due to the difficulties of preventing cheating over the internet.</p>

<p>Instead, the weekend was filled with guest speakers, alumni pannels, a MIT admissions talk, and small group connection sessions.</p>

<p>The weekend started off with an MIT admissions talk, which was pretty similar to the standard talk and tour MIT gives.</p>

<p>A couple hours later, there was a small group connection session, where we were paired with a couple other students and alumni. I unfortunately missed this event so I canâ€™t say too much about it, but it sounded super cool.</p>

<p>Later that eveing, there was an alumni panel. The panel featured one college student as well as multiple women who had already graduated. Although all of the panelists were very talented at math in high school, it was amazing to see all the different fields such as writing or public policy they ended up in. One key takeaway from the panel was to keep an open mind about what major and field you choose to work in. I think that there is a lot of pressure to choose early, as ever since childhood people are always asking what do you want to do when you grow up? This panel reminded me that its good to explore different areas in college and beyond.</p>

<p>The next day, there was a closing ceremony with multiple speakers. There were both technical and general presentations. One of my favorite talks was by Professor Dana Randall from Georgia Tech on Domino Tilings. Overall, I was exposed to fascinating computer science and mathematics topics while also inspired by successful female mathematicians and scientists.</p>

<p>Although it was disappointing to not be able to travel to MIT and have an actual competition, Math Prize 2020 still deepened my mathematical knowledge and gave me female role models to look up to. I look forward to participating again next year(hopefully in person!) and would strongly recommend MathPrize to fellow young female mathematicians!</p>
